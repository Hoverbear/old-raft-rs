//! A `StateMachine` is a single instance of a distributed application. It is the `raft` libraries
//! responsibility to take commands from the `Client` and apply them to each `StateMachine`
//! instance in a globally consistent order.
//!
//! The `StateMachine` is interface is intentionally generic so that any distributed application
//! needing consistent state can be built on it.  For instance, a distributed hash table
//! application could implement `StateMachine`, with commands corresponding to `insert`, and
//! `remove`. The `raft` library would guarantee that the same order of `insert` and `remove`
//! commands would be seen by all consensus modules.
